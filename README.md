This is a simple Java program that uses a hashmap-based index and stores the data in a binary file `simple_db`. The program acts like a bankbox where the user can store an item and a value of that item. 

1. To use this program, clone the repository with your favorite terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/KIMB0/database-simple-db.git
```

2. You can run the program on two of the following ways:
    1. From a program that can compile java code (IntelliJ, Netbeans, ect.)

    2. Or you can use your terminal to compile and run the Java file. Do the following:

    Be in the root of the project and navigate to the src/ folder in the project:
    ```
    $ cd src/
    ```
    From here run the following in the terminal:
    ```
    $ javac com/company/Main.java
    ```
    And finally run:
    ```
    $ java com/company/Main
    ```
    The the program should run.
